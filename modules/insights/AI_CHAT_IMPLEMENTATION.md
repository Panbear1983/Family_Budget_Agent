## 🚀 How It Works

### User asks: "七月花了多少？"

```
1. Language Detector → Detects: Chinese (0.95 confidence)
2. Guardrails → Check: ✅ Budget-related (has "七月", "花了", "多少")
3. Classifier → Type: instant_answer, Entities: {month: "七月"}
4. Instant Answers → Compute: NT$27,300 (Python only, no LLM)
5. Formatter → Add: Emoji, follow-ups
6. Output: "七月總支出 NT$27,300 💡 要看圖表嗎？"
```

**Time: 0.2 seconds** ⚡

### User asks: "Why is August expensive?"

```
1. Language Detector → Detects: English (0.90 confidence)
2. Guardrails → Check: ✅ Budget-related
3. Classifier → Type: insight, Entities: {month: "八月"}
4. Data Preprocessor → Compute: stats, trends, anomalies
5. Prompt Builder → Build Qwen prompt: "Extract key data"
6. Qwen → Output: "Food +NT$3,200, Transport +NT$1,800"
7. Prompt Builder → Build GPT-OSS prompt: "Explain why"
8. GPT-OSS → Output: "August spending increased mainly because..."
9. Guardrails → Validate: ✅ Numbers verified, no hallucinations
10. Formatter → Add: Emojis, structure, follow-ups
11. Output: "📈 August spending increased mainly because..."
```

**Time: 8 seconds** 🧠

## 🛡️ Guardrails - Whitelist-Only

### ✅ Allowed Topics (Must contain these keywords)
- Spending: 花費, 支出, spending, expense
- Budget: 預算, budget, planning
- Categories: 伙食, 交通, food, transport
- Analysis: 分析, 趨勢, trend, compare
- Forecast: 預測, forecast, predict
- Savings: 節省, save, reduce

### ❌ Anything Else → Rejected
- General chat → "抱歉，我只能回答預算相關問題"
- Finance-adjacent → "我專注於家庭預算，不涉及投資理財"
- Off-topic → Generic redirect with examples

## 🚦 How to Test

1. **Start the system:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/peter/Desktop/Old_Projects/GitHub/Family_Budget_Agent
   source venv/bin/activate
   python _main.py
   ```

2. **Select option [3] - 預算分析對話**

3. **Try these questions:**
   - `七月花了多少？` (instant answer)
   - `Why did spending increase in August?` (insight)
   - `給我看每月支出圖表` (visualization)
   - `預測下個月支出` (forecast)
   - `Compare July and August` (comparison)
   - `找出可以節省的地方` (optimization)

4. **Test guardrails (should reject):**
   - `What's the weather today?` (off-topic)
   - `Should I invest in stocks?` (finance-adjacent)
   - `Tell me a joke` (general chat)

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Optional)

- [ ] Voice input/output (speech recognition)
- [ ] Export conversations to PDF
- [ ] Learning mode (log rejected questions to improve whitelist)
- [ ] Multi-turn guided workflows (budget planning wizard)
- [ ] Integration with bank APIs (auto-import transactions)

---

## 📝 Notes

- All modules use type hints and docstrings
- No linting errors in any file
- Fully integrated with existing BudgetChat module
- Backward compatible (old features still work)
- Language config in `config.py` for easy customization
